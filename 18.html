        <h3> Life Skills and Leadership Manual</h3>
        <p class="bottomindent">The Life Skills and Leadership Manual features approximately 45 hours of highly participatory session plans (25 sessions) designed to be a resource for Volunteers leading a wide range of positive youth development activities in any sector. Those who want to learn to integrate life and leadership skills training into their relationships and activities with youth in their communities are encouraged to use this valuable resource.  The sessions are divided into four units that address personal and interpersonal development, goal setting and action planning, and leadership and teamwork. Experienced Volunteers and counterparts and those with less experience facilitating participatory training activities will all benefit by using the training package and paying special attention to facilitator notes in the manual sessions. This manual is a new ICE publication. The existing Life Skills Manual, [ICE No. M0063] published in 2001, has been renamed Life Skills for Sexual and Reproductive Health Manual, and has retained its ICE number.</p>
